# Neo4j Map Loader

To use the map loader:
- Make sure you have Node 6.2+ installed
- Make sure Neo4j is running
- Change the Neo4j password in main.js
- Open a terminal and do the following:
```
npm install # this installs dependencies and only needs to be done once
node main.js # this runs the script. Change parameters in main.js and run this again if you want
```

After running the script, go here to see the map loaded into Neo4j: http://plnkr.co/edit/JEnofiJzz4KZdFZq7gks?p=preview
